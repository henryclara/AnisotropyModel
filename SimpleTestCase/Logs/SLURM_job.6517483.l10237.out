Finding periodic nodes in direction 1
Coordinate in dimension 1 is at the interval [2.2e+05, 2.3e+05]
Looking for 66 periodic nodes
Finding periodic nodes in direction 2
Coordinate in dimension 2 is at the interval [3.2e+05, 3.25e+05]
Looking for 66 periodic nodes
Found all in all 132 periodic nodes.
PartitionSimpleElements
Making a simple partitioning for 500 elements in 3-dimensions.
Ordering 1st direction with (1*x + 0.0001*y + 1e-08*z)
Creating an inverse topology of the finite element mesh
There are from 1 to 8 connections in the inverse topology.
Each node is in average in 5.510 elements
Number of nodal partitions: 4
Set the node partitions by the dominating element partition.
There are from 251 to 394 nodes in the 4 partitions.
Successfully made a partitioning with 125 to 125 elements.
